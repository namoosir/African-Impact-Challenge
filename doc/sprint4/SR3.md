Practices that we should continue for the next sprint:
The regular meetings are now around 30 min which should be continued. 
We should also continue regularly updating each other on blockers and spikes, 
so that the team can help each other with the tasks.

New practices for the next sprint: 			
Make sure that amount of work we assign is within the team capacity.
Try to help other teammates as early as possible so they can move from whatever is blocking them.
Also, research new APIs to know how hard a task that depends on that API could be. 

Harmful practices that we should stop: 
Not reassessing the difficulty of a spike after it was assigned.	
Procrastination. Relying too much on one of the team members. 
Introduce too many dependencies on other teammates.

Best and worst experiences for sprint 3. 
Best: When the different components of the project worked together,
learning something, and working together to get everything done.
Worst: Being stuck at various bugs as well attempting to use the Zoom API. The pressure from time constraints.
