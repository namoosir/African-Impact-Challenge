## Spikes
The user story “ As a user, I want to be able to host live meetings so that I can discuss things with my peers and/or partners.” poses a problem in that we are not sure how to implement the feature meetings and are stuck after attempting to use the Zoom API. The plan is to find a different API or feature to allow us to implement this feature. The story  “As a user, I want to be able to directly message other users so that I can directly contact other users through the website” also seems unknown to the group and will take some investigation to be completed.
