## Spikes
The user story “As a company administrator (Tomi), I want to be able to upload information such as financials
and pitch decks so that investors get a better idea of the company.” poses a problem in that we are not sure
how exactly we can upload and retrieve files. As such, we have to learn how to handle files and how to 
actually upload them into the website locally. We cannot estimate how long it will take us to learn how to
upload files.
