Team Expectation Agreement
Methods of communication
Discord is the main medium of communication.
Email will be used occasionally when giving a lot of information at once.
Communication response times 
Within 2-5 hours is the expected timeframe for replying to discord messages and emails depending on the time and day to accommodate possible conflicts with all the member’s timetables.
Regular Meetings 
We will be doing 1-2 meetings every week in which we expect every member to be available unless given a sufficiently good justification for their absence such as feeling ill. 
Running meetings 
Meetings will be held over Discord or Zoom to accommodate all the members as there are some that are currently outside Canada. These meetings will typically have a 30 minute duration, but if necessary the duration can be extended or shortened at the team’s discretion.
We will try to have meetings at 8pm EST to accommodate everyone. After every meeting we will write a summary and post it in discord for anyone who missed the meeting as  well as a way for us to remember ideas.
Meeting Preparation
Generally no preparation will be needed. We will try to decide during the previous meeting what preparation will be needed for the next meeting.
The only preparation may be needed if we are practicing a presentation.

Version Control
Log messages should be meaningful and give an idea of what you included or added. Mention user story.
Do not commit unfinished and untested work to the master branch. Work must pass unit tests. For conflicts with other people’s work, try to contact them and solve it together.

Division of work 
Work should be divided up as evenly as possible through the user backlog and we will jointly decide on the distribution to ensure fairness.
If someone needs help, they are welcome to ask for aid via discord or email to solve issues or doubts.
Will make sure that the difficulty and estimated time to complete for everyone is similar.
Submitting work 
Ideally, we at least want a passable iteration of our work to be uploaded for submission as early as possible. We can iterate and resubmit our work as we improve it.
Everybody is responsible to ensure that the project is error-free, however, everyone should try their best in order to have as few mistakes as possible.
Mutasem will generally submit the work 3-4 hours in advance at the latest.
Contingency planning 
If a teammate drops out or gets extremely sick, the work will be distributed amongst each teammate evenly, or whatever arrangement the team agrees on.
 The team will seek out help from the instructor in case of major issues to not to let such situations escalate.
