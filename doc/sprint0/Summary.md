Objective: 
Build an application for entrepreneurs as part of the African Impact Challenge. The application is a combination of a learning and social media platform for entrepreneurs to learn, network, and collaborate on their product and entrepreneurial ideas. It allows the entrepreneurs to learn from instructors, as well as discuss their ideas with each other and various investors.

Key Users:
Entrepreneurs: This is the main user of the application. They are generally young adults with an idea. They will create a profile which they will use to access the learning and community pages to learn, network, and collaborate.

Company Administrator: This user represents the entrepreneur(s) who will create, edit, and deal with the company profile. This is a detailed profile with information about the company and its staff. This user can make changes to the company, and manage the individuals within the company.

Partner/investor: This user is usually older adults who are more experienced and want to support the entrepreneur. They will mostly interact with the entrepreneur and other investors through the global feed or through messaging.

Key Scenarios:

Partner/investor: While browsing the company profiles, Kojo sees a company that they are interested in. They go on the company profile, find the list of employees/founders, go to the founders profile and send them a message to chat.

Entrepreneurs: Tomi sees a workshop that they are interested in and decides they want to participate. They navigate to the calendar, find the correct date, select the link for the live workshop and attend it.

Company Administrator: Tomi is an entrepreneur and a founder of his company. He would like to update the financial sheets for the company as well as edit some information so that potential investors are aware of the state of the company. He signs into the company account, uploads the financial information and updates the profile. 





Key Principles:
User Centered Design: The design should be accessible for any type of user, following usability and accessibility principles and provide a great user experience.
