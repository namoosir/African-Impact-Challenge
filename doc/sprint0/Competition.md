Competition

Quercus: (https://q.utoronto.ca)
How is our product different from Quercus:
- Quercus doesn’t really have different types of users, other than professors and students. Not really a company profile
- Doesn’t really have a DM feature
- You cannot make public posts 
- Profile is lackluster. 
- Different purposes (entrepreneurs vs students)
- Quercus is open only for UofT students and there is no way to apply otherwise. On the other hand, for our product, registration is open to everyone as long as they apply and are accepted through the annual challenge application.
- How is our product better than Quercus:
	- Our product is better:
		- When there is need for interaction between users within a community
		- When there is need for collaboration 
	- Our product is targeted at:
		- Our product would be better for entrepreneurs as compared to Quercus because Quercus is more focused on e-learning rather than community collaboration and 			  interaction.
	- Why didn’t Quercus focus on these scenarios/users?
		- Quercus didn’t focus on entrepreneurs because their main target is schools and institutions. 
		- Quercus would need a considerable influx of entrepreneurs who use the application. Since the vast majority of users are either students or teachers, then it 			  wouldn’t make sense to implement entrepreneurial features. That is, unless more entrepreneurs start learning through Quercus and so there would be a market for 		    the incorporation of entrepreneurial features.








LinkedIn: (https://www.linkedin.com)
	How is our product different from LinkedIn:
LinkedIn’s purpose is to promote networking, whereas our product helps African entrepreneurs succeed and help them promote their ideas.
LinkedIn does not have a calendar feature, whereas our product does.
LinkedIn learning and LinkedIn are treated separately rather than one whole application. As such, we separate the interaction from the educational aspect of the application.
Our product provides a platform for live sessions and workshops, as well as for pre-recorded lectures all in one.
LinkedIn is open to everyone just by signing up with a valid email. Our product, however, is more selective since only selected users from the annual challenge application can be users.
	How is product better than Linkedin:
		Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
Our product would be better for close interactions and private communities.
Our product would be better for companies looking for funding from partners/investors.
Our product would be better for entrepreneurs looking for live sessions/workshops.
Our product would be better for entrepreneurs looking for a calendar feature in which to put all their itinerary.
When there is need for companies to look for funding
When there is a need for entrepreneurs to learn through the application
		Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or
 	scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?
LinkedIn didn’t focus on a live and/or educational integration to their networking platform due to the purpose of the application. LinkedIn serves as a networking platform. As such, it makes no sense to integrate education as an integral part of the application. 
For LinkedIn to take steps towards integrating the educational platform within their networking platform, there must be a shift in which people looking for jobs and for networking are also looking to learn in the same platform. At the moment, it is not really a big need for that in the context of what LinkedIn entails.
