Participants: Andy, Nazmus, Mutasem, Julio, Rebecca, Sneha

Unfinished tasks in the form of a user story: As a user, I want to be able to customize my public profile so that others can see who I am as a person.

Practices that we should continue for the next sprint:
	Regular meetings.
	Asking each other for help.

New practices for the next sprint:
	Split up work more fairly now that we have an idea of how much time it takes.
	Make user stories smaller.
	Assign work as early as possible.
	More communication

Harmful practices that we should stop:
	 Procrastination
	 Switching the tasks that someone is assigned.

Best and worse experiences for sprint 1:
	Best:
		When the different components of the project worked together
		Learning something new
		Working together to get everything done
	Worst:
		Being over overwhelmed by the number of things to learn
		The pressure from time constraint
