Spikes
The user story “As a developer, I want to learn React, MongoDB, NodeJS and Express so that I can complete all the features for the project” is very different for everyone, therefore the time cannot be estimated.
 
The testing user story subtasks are difficult to estimate since we do not have experience testing web applications.
