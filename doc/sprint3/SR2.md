Practices that we should continue for the next sprint:
The regular meetings are now around 30 min.
Asking each other for help.
Assigning everyone a fair amount of work right when the sprint starts.


New practices for the next sprint:
Make sure that amount of work we assign is within the team capacity.
Try to help other teammates as early as possible so they can move from whatever is blocking them.


Harmful practices that we should stop:
Procrastination.
Switching the tasks that someone is assigned.
Relying too much on one of the team members.

Best and worse experiences for sprint 1:
	Best:
		When the different components of the project worked together
		Learning something new
		Working together to get everything done
	Worst:
		Being over overwhelmed by the number of things to learn
		The pressure from time constraint
