## Spikes
The user story “ As a user, I want to be able to host live meetings so that I can discuss things with my 
peers and/or partners.” poses a problem in that we are not sure how to implement the feature meetings. 
As such, the plan is to use the zoom API to have an embedded video interface in the website. 
This was hard to estimate points for because we are not sure of the difficulty of using the zoom API. 
Likewise, the story “As an instructor (Jaime), I would like to be able to post video recordings 
and other notes/assignments so that the entrepreneurs can see them” was also difficult to estimate 
because uploading videos seemed different from uploading documents and posed an uncertainty for the group.
